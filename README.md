# Barrrage
Senior Capstone Project

## Description
Barrage is a 2D Tower Defense game with trivia questions that aim to improve users' knowledge and what they know. With multiple different types of troops, users can have fun experimenting with different map layouts and troop placements.

I collaborated with fellow student Joshua Villareal on this project together. We are proud of what we accomplished in 4 months even if every feature was not optimized and some were missing.
